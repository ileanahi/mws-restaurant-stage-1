# Restaurant Reviews
---

## Project Overview

This is a Udacity project for the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. I used a Service Worker to cache data for offline or lie-fi use. I also used media queries to convert the static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Accessibility guidelines were followed to make the web application screen reader friendly.
